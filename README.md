# hydra-ai

 ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§

Script and proxy to work with AI (specifically Stable diffusion) in [Hydra](https://github.com/ojack/hydra/).

API & Functions are WIP and going to change

```Js
await loadScript('https://hydra-ai-milan.glitch.me/ai.js')

keyDreamstudio.value = "YOUR Dreamstudio API KEY"

//or
keyReplicate.value = "YOUR Replicate API KEY"
settings.value.server = "Replicate"

s0.initAi('a closeup of a hydra')
```

The reference to your key `keyDreamstudio.value = "YOUR Dreamstudio API KEY"` can (and should) be removed afterwards

It gets saved in your local storage, which is not really secure and could be stolen by other scripts running on the same domainâ€¦ still thinking about a better solution. But the local storage means that can share the script with other people, and it's going to use their own API Key


```Js
await loadScript('https://hydra-ai-milan.glitch.me/ai.js')

s0.initAi('a closeup of a hydra')

src(s0).out()

```

## Plans

- improve the API-Key situation
- Simplify the API
- General model support
- local support (through replicate cog)
